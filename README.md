#Auto Nerf Turret!

This repository contains purely arduino code in C for the control of motors, servos and PIR sensor central to the control of an automatic nerf turret.

##Goals
- [x] Get manual control working
- [ ] Mount gun to lazy susan
  - [ ] Order lazy susan
  - [ ] Buy wood
  - [ ] Construct mount
- [ ] Implement ultrasonic personel tracking algorithm
  - [x] Order ultrasonic modules
  - [ ] Write algorithm

##About us
Keble HackSoc is a small society at Keble College, University of Oxford consisting of a team of 4 students including @jarthur36 (CompSci) and @InvisibleTree (Engineering). This first project involves producing an AI controlled nerf gun turret with 2 axes of rotation and target tracking.

##Meeting log
- **Weds 11th Jan** Plans were drawn up, motors ordered and intial thought given to the code
- **Weds 18th Jan** Code written for manual control with a thumbstick, PIR sensor works for motion detection, motors and buzzer wired up for first working prototype of the mechanics. Ordered an ultrasonic module ready for tracking algorithm
